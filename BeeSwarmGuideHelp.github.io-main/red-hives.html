        <h1>Red Hive Guide (v2.1)</h1>
        <p>By Sakurance</p>
    </header>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This guide covers a broad range of topics for self-learning and understanding.
            Readers with a short attention span are advised to skip the guide due to its extensive content.
            <strong>Boosting Takes Practice:</strong> Learning how to boost is tough to explain. You really have to try it yourself to get what I'm saying. It's like riding a bike – you won't get it just by reading about it. Boosting requires consistent practice and understanding where you went wrong.
            <strong>Top Red Players Have Ups and Downs:</strong> Even the best players in the game have good days and bad days. Getting good at boosting isn't something that just happens; you have to keep practicing and learn from your mistakes. Boosting, as a skill, involves experiencing highs and lows, and success comes from continuous macro management and frequent boosting.
            <strong>Guide Can't Make You the Best:</strong> This guide won't magically make you one of the top players. To be really, really good, you need to keep track of lots of things, boost a bunch, maybe use more than one account, or do well in special events. This guide gives you the basics; the rest is up to you. Also, to be in the red level, you need specific tools like the scorch saw, dark scythe, and at least a level 18 hive with Digital Bee.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Hive Builds</h2>
        <p>For this section, I’ll be providing many alternatives for red hives as well as swappable bees and suggestions.</p>
        <h3>NOTES:</h3>
        <p>Highly recommended to have 500 red drives on your digital as these hives synergize really well with a decent digital. Additionally, some of the boosting tips won’t apply without max red digital. All bees have to be gifted for all builds, otherwise you won’t be making much due to the lack of precise marks, target collection, flame fuel and inspire stacks. If you don’t have bear bee game pass then give up, x2 pollen is massive and there are no alternatives to this. Make your own adjustments as you progressively get better. Meta guides define a general structure to a hive and may not work for all hives depending on skill level, pc/network specs, or amulets.</p>
        <h3>General:</h3>
        <p>I have provided two variations of a hive to START WITH. These are just beginner templates for what you might run in the future. As you boost, you’ll realize that you might need more spicy, more precise, less carp, or more vectors. YOU have to understand what you need. These are not universal hives. They don’t work for everyone, but they’re a great starting point if you just started building a red hive. Some players may or may not like hasty in their hive. If you’re one of the few lucky players who manage to get 2 smiley stickers with honey mark ability, you could even drop down to 2 or even 1 carp.</p>
        <!-- Include hive build information -->
        <h3>Robo Challenge Build:</h3>
        <p>You could honestly run a typical red hive for RBC, but it requires some decent luck, such as not getting high blue or white pollen quests. Adding tadpole provides blue boost for blue pollen quests. You can swap out the extra vectors for precise depending on personal preference. Windy provides white boost for high white pollen quest. If you have gummyballer (by chance), then use it for high goo quests (r24-25). More information found in “Robo Bear Challenge Guide”. This comp needs 500 white drives along with 500 red to efficiently work</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>FAQ (regarding all comps)</h2>
        <p><strong>Why is there no fire bee?</strong></p>
        <p>Most of your pollen comes from targets not flames.</p>
        <p><strong>If I don’t have them all gifted immediately, which bees should I prioritize?</strong></p>
        <p>Precise (until most gifted) → Spicy (until 7) → Vectors (until 6) → gift rest (you can also gift precise and spicy at the same time since they require different treats)</p>
        <p><strong>I don’t have a digital bee. Should I still follow these hives?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, refer to “Robo Bear Challenge Guide” for an easy way to get digital.</p>
        <p><strong>I don’t get enough ____ tokens while boosting, what do I do?</strong></p>
        <p>Add 1-2 of the corresponding bees or try different combinations. ex) If you struggle with haste and focus, then get a commander with a whistle. Adjust your hive to what YOU need.</p>
        <p><strong>How do I efficiently get drives?</strong></p>
        <p>Refer to “Robo Bear Challenge Guide” for drive run strategies.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Amulets</h2>
        <p>Just using max stats as a reference, it’s not necessary to get every little % but rather getting as high as possible. ALL of these amulets are at the highest rarity of course.</p>
        <!-- Include amulets information from the original text -->
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Beequips</h2>
        <p>Non-beesmas (accessible in the Dapper Shop)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sweatband (on Digital) - only if you have 500 white drives</li>
            <li>Kazoo (on Buoyant) - gives melody</li>
            <li>Whistle (on Rage or Brave) - gives haste</li>
            <li>Charm Bracelet (on Carpenter) - bee ability rate and mark duration</li>
            <li>2 Smiley Stickers (on Vector) - only use these if you get honey mark on both (caustic only)</li>
            <!-- Add more beequips as needed -->
        </ul>

        <p>Beequips for Beesmas</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Peppermint Antenna (on Bear)</li>
            <!-- Add more Beesmas beequips as needed -->
        </ul>
        <p>Notes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have remaining case slots then use beesmas tree hats on precise</li>
            <li>“I don’t own these beequips” or “I don’t have enough slots,” well too bad. Don’t throw out an equip just because it's missing bee ability pollen, these beequips don’t come year round and even without the bonus, the abilities granted can completely shift your hive composition.</li>
        </ul>
